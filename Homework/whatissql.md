What is SQL?
=============

_By Myriam Ochoa_



Introduction
------------

SQL stands for Structured Query Language. It is a standard programming language specifically designed for managing and manipulating relational databases. SQL is used to perform various operations on the data stored in a database, such as querying, inserting, updating, and deleting data. It also includes commands for creating, modifying, and dropping databases and tables, as well as setting permissions on tables, procedures, and views.


Sql vs. Other Storage Solutions
-------------------------------

SQL databases, known for their structured schema and relational data management, excel in applications requiring complex queries and strict data integrity, making them ideal for traditional business systems like banking and CRM. In contrast, NoSQL databases offer flexibility and scalability with various data models, catering to unstructured data and large-scale applications. In-memory databases provide high-speed data access for real-time processing, whereas file storage systems offer simplicity for managing digital assets. Object storage, with its flat namespace and scalability, is well-suited for storing vast amounts of data in cloud-based applications. The choice between SQL and other storage solutions depends on the application's specific needs, including data structure, performance, and scalability requirements.

 

Sql Commands
------------
### The SELECT Statement

The SELECT statement in SQL is used to query and retrieve data from a database. It allows users to specify precisely which data they want to see by selecting specific columns from one or more tables. Users can also use various clauses such as WHERE to filter the data, JOIN to combine data from multiple tables, GROUP BY to aggregate data, and ORDER BY to sort the results. 

Example:

SELECT * FROM Customers;


### The INSERT Statement
The INSERT statement in SQL is used to add new rows of data to a table in a database. It allows users to specify the target table and the values to be inserted, either for all columns in a strict sequence or for a specific subset of columns, providing flexibility in data entry. 

Example: 

INSERT INTO Customers (CustomerID, Name, Address, City)

VALUES (1, 'John Doe', '123 Elm Street', 'Springfield');

### The UPDATE Statement
The UPDATE statement in SQL is used to modify existing records in a database table. It allows users to specify the table to be updated, set new values for one or more columns, and use a WHERE clause to narrow down the records to be affected. 

Example:

UPDATE Customers

Address = '456 Oak Street'

WHERE CustomerID = 1;

### The DELETE Statement

The DELETE statement in SQL is used to remove one or more records from a database table. It provides the capability to specify which rows should be deleted using a WHERE clause, allowing for precise control over the data removal process.

Example:

DELETE FROM Customers

WHERE CustomerID = 1;

Sql Clauses
-----------
### The WHERE Clause
The WHERE clause in SQL is a powerful tool used to filter records in a query, ensuring that only those rows that meet specific criteria are selected, updated, or deleted. By specifying conditions that the data must satisfy, the WHERE clause enables precise control over database operations, making it possible to work with subsets of data within larger tables

Example:

SELECT *

FROM Employees

WHERE Age > 30 AND Department = 'Marketing';


### The ORDER BY Clause
The ORDER BY clause in SQL is used to sort the results of a query in ascending or descending order based on one or more columns. The ORDER BY clause can be applied to the results of a SELECT statement, allowing users to view data in an ordered fashion, which is particularly useful for reporting and data presentation purposes.

Example:

SELECT ProductName, Price

FROM Products

ORDER BY Price ASC;


### The GROUP BY Clause

The GROUP BY clause in SQL is used to aggregate rows that have the same values in specified columns into summary rows, like "grouping" the results by one or more columns. This is particularly useful when used in conjunction with aggregate functions (such as COUNT, SUM, AVG, MAX, MIN), allowing you to perform calculations on each group of data

Example:

SELECT OrderDate, SUM(TotalAmount) AS DailySales

FROM Orders

GROUP BY OrderDate;


### The LIMIT Clause

The LIMIT clause in SQL is used to specify the maximum number of records to return from a query. This is particularly useful for managing large datasets by allowing you to retrieve just a portion of the results, which can be essential for performance in applications that require pagination or when testing queries on large tables.

Example:

SELECT EmployeeID, Name, Salary

FROM Employees

ORDER BY Salary DESC

LIMIT 5;


Other Sql Commands
------------------

### The CREATE TABLE Command


The CREATE statement in SQL is used to construct new database objects, such as tables, views, indexes, and more. This command is fundamental for setting up the structure of a database according to the specific requirements of an application or dataset.

Example:

CREATE TABLE Customers (
    
CustomerID int,
   
 Name varchar(255),
   
 Address varchar(255),
    
City varchar(255) 
);


### The ALTER TABLE Command

The ALTER statement in SQL is a versatile command used to modify the structure of an existing database object, such as a table, without affecting the data it contains. This could involve adding, deleting, or modifying columns in a table, changing data types, or adjusting constraints. 

Example:

ALTER TABLE Customers

ADD Email varchar(255);


### The DROP TABLE Command

The UPDATE statement in SQL is used to modify existing records in a table, allowing for the change of data values in one or more columns. It's a critical command for maintaining the accuracy and relevance of the data stored within a database. By specifying conditions with a WHERE clause, the UPDATE statement can target specific records, making it possible to precisely adjust data as needed. 

Example:

UPDATE Customers

SET Address = '456 Oak Street'

WHERE CustomerID = 1;


### The TRUNCATE TABLE Command
The TRUNCATE statement in SQL is used to delete all rows from a table quickly and efficiently, resetting the table to its empty state. Unlike the DELETE command, which removes rows one at a time and logs each deletion, 

Example:

TRUNCATE TABLE Customers;
